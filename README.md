### GSG library :book:
#### control Panel that contains :
* Dashboard that has the total of books and member of GSG.
* Page that has table to view all  out books and member.
* Page that has all books and all information about it, and can delete and update any book else can search about any book.
* page allows you to lend a book.
* Page allows you to add new book.

### Problem Statement :boom:
wasting time and effort by lend a book manually, else can't remember the person who lent the book.
